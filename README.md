# Yet another cheatsheet for vim

I originally made this cheatsheet for my students, with the hope it would also help me be more efficient with vim.

But this work is not only my own. Some corrections have been made based on the suggestions of r/vim from Reddit. ( Many thanks to them ).
Some inspiration also came from other cheatsheets available on the Internet.

So don't hesitate to use and modify it : make it yours and send me feedback !

You will find in this repository the Latex source file, a Makefile, and of course the pdf.
If you are only interested into downloading the pdf file, you can click [here](https://github.com/SebDruon/cheatsheet_vim/blob/master/cheatsheet_vim.pdf)

Have fun,

Seb
