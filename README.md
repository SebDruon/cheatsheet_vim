# Yet another cheatsheet for vim

I made this cheatsheet for my students, and hope it can help you.
So please don't hesitate to use it, modify it, and send me feedback !

You will find in this repository the Latex source file, a Makefile, and of course the pdf.
If you are only interested into downloading the pdf file, you can click [here](https://github.com/SebDruon/cheatsheet_vim/blob/master/cheatsheet_vim.pdf)

As usual, this work is not only my own. Some corrections have been made based on the suggestions of r/vim from Reddit. ( Many thanks to them ).
Some inspiration also came from other cheatsheets available on the Internet ( and you should definitely have a look on [quickref](https://quickref.me/vim) )

One last advice : cheatsheets are great during the first days of using vim, but they are not the best way to start. If you haven't done it yet, please have a look on :vimtutor. It's a gret step-by-step introduction to this wonderful tool.

Have fun,
Seb
